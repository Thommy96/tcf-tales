## Content of this overview
This overview contains information about the enclosed query results. These results were generated with Neo4j in the framework of our Text Technology project called tcf-tales. It contains data about relations between nouns in a collection of fairy tales.
## Motivation
As we investigated the relations between nouns we ran into a problem: There are many different nouns and appart from the most frequent ones the relations between them were hard to research. In an effort to make the relations more clear we created categories and put those nouns in categories, that fit and were frequent (in the Top Nouns file).
### Categories
First and foremost in our resarch of relations between nouns we wanted to investigate especially characters, but as research continued other nouns also catched your interests. So we came up with 12 Categories:
Adel (Nobility), Tier (Animal), Fabelwesen (Mythical Creature), Männlich (Male), Weiblich (Female), Gewerbebezeichnung (Profession Title), Wertgegenstände (Valuables), Orte (Places), Eigenname (Proper Name), Beziehung (Relation), Nahrung (Food), Körperteil (Body Part).
